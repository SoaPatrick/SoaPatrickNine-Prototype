  </header>

  <main>  
    <p>After a day of <a href="https://www.soapatrick.com/2021/01/2020-in-numbers/" data-type="post" data-id="5696">numbers</a> and a day of <a href="https://www.soapatrick.com/2021/01/some-thoughts-on-2020/" data-type="post" data-id="5701">looking back</a>, it’s time to look ahead of talk about what to expect from 2021. The thing I noticed last year is that I was lacking a clear focus on things. I had all these ideas in my head and I was jumping between them way too frequently and not really seeing it through until the end. So my mantra for this year is:</p>
    <blockquote class="is-style-large"><p>be more focused</p></blockquote>
    <p>And with that in mind, here are a few things I try to be more focused on.</p>
    <h2>SoaPatrickNine</h2>
    <p>What? A new version already, isn’t SP8 rather new? Well yeah, but I keep tinkering with stuff here constantly and the rule so far has been a new version every year 8 months or so. The thing is, I plan on changing quite a few things, SP8 was a new step and I want to continue this direction and go even further. So I plan on having a real landing page, I plan on incorporating Blender renderings, and I plan on having a Soap Lab section.</p>

    <p>Now I don’t know the timeframe for all this, but I will hopefully start with sketches and prototypes soon. </p>
    <h2>Blender</h2>
    <p>This is kinda connected to SP9 as I mentioned above that I want to incorporate renderings into the design, but that is just one thing I plan on doing this year. Of course, I’d love to get better with Blender, create new exciting things, and maybe even some new animations. I think the most important thing is to keep playing with it and try new things. The web is full of tutorials and just by recreating the things from the tutorials, I learn new things.</p>
    <h2>Short Films</h2>
    <p>Last year I finished only one short film (the Blender animated <a href="https://www.soapatrick.com/factory/race/" data-type="factory" data-id="5439">Race</a> scene) but this year I actually want to finish a few things. I think I have to dial it back on the quality control and maybe even on the complexity and just film short ideas and test new stuff. I know I’m saying that for years now, I just hope with my mantra this year I will actually succeed.</p>
    <p>I have two shorts in my head, one is a rather personal story and the other is just based on an idea, but maybe some other ideas will pop into my head and I will film, edit and mix them within a day. I remember the first idea for <a href="https://www.soapatrick.com/factory/reflection/" data-type="factory" data-id="4346">Reflection</a> was finished within a day, so I know I can do it, just have to actually do it and not write/talk about it.</p>
    <h2>Photographs</h2>
    <p>Towards the end of last year, I started taking pictures at home again, shooting portraits and I really loved it. I don’t have a real studio with the possibility of having different backdrops and different light setups and there are ideas to build something. But I think for this year the goal has to be to do things more often, get better at it and THEN think about building a studio at home.</p>
    <h2>Streets of Basel</h2>
    <p>For <a href="https://www.soapatrick.com/2019/01/why-not-a-look-ahead/" data-type="post" data-id="3273">2019</a> I had this plan to walk through every street in Basel and for a time I made good progress on that plan. then everything came to a halt. It wasn’t until 2020 where I continued with this plan but there still is a big part of Basel which is missing. So hopefully I will make steady progress this year and be able to finish my map by December.</p>
